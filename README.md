## 
Perform a Gibbs sampler for hurdle joint models focusing on estimating joint models for zero-inflated longitudinal measurements and time-to-event data. This versatile package accommodates various distributional assumptions, including Gaussian, Gamma, inverse Gaussian, Weibull, exponential, beta, Poisson, negative binomial, logarithmic, Bell, generalized Poisson, and binomial. These models, as described in Ganjali et al. (2024), are implemented through two key functions: "ZIJM" for joint modeling with a proportional hazard sub-model and a piecewise constant baseline hazard, and "ZISRE" for joint modeling with a Weibull sub-model incorporating a shared random effects model.
